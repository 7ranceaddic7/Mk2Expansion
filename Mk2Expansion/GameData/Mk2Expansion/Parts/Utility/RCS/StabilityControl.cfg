	description = Keeping a spaceplane steady as it hurls through the sky at mach 5 can be difficult at times. Rockets can rely on SAS torque wheels, but mk2 aircraft can either stuff some in a cargo bay or make do with a very limited selection of RCS thrusters. The SC-01 seeks to solve both problems.

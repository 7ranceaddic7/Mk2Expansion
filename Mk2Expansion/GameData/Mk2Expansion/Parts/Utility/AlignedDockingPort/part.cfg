	title = Clamp-O-Tron Mk2 Docking Port
	description = Invented after a peaceful protest against the lack of spacecraft attachment systems turned violent, the Clamp-O-Tron Docking Port allows for the firm attachment of two separate vessels. After docking, vessels can be just as easily undocked. This models is intended for mk2 craft, and comes with a low profile docking shroud to ensure a seamless and aligned connection between two vessels.

	description = Intended for use on aerospace assets built using mk2 hulls, the SPL H-D is a compact, heavy duty landing leg. Low profile enough to fit snugly into an included aeroshell housing, yet over-engineered enough to withstand the roughest of landings, this is a must have for VTOL craft and offworld landers alike.

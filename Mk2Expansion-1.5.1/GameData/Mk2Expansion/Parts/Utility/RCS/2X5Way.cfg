	description = After learning of the public's insatiable desire for Reaction Control Systems, the engineers rolled out the 'Aero' series of aerodynamic RCS blocks for utilization on air and space craft. The aerodynamic housing does come at the cost of some thruster power, however. This one features heavy duty 3-axis control.
